## Unreleased

## [2.0.0] 2019-12-01

### Changed
- Action parameters and return are now statically typed. **This change breaks the public API**: execution models relying on the generic `Object` type for parameter and return now need to cast values to the expected type. (e.g. `ChatPlatform.Reply(message)` now requires that `message` is a `String`, this can be fixed with the following syntax `ChatPlatform.Reply(message as String)`).  


## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-10
